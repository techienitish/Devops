All-Ingress
Overview:
Edit
Ingress exposes HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster.
Traffic routing is controlled by rules defined on the Ingress resource. An Ingress may be configured to give Services externally-reachable URLs, load balance traffic, terminate SSL / TLS, and offer name-based virtual hosting.

Pre-requisite:

K8’s project URL which consist of ingress manifest.
Environment/Cluster and the namespace where “all-ingress” needs to be configured.
