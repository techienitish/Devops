**Load Balancer vs. Ingress Controller in Kubernetes – What’s the Difference? **

When exposing applications in Kubernetes, should you use a Load Balancer or an Ingress Controller? 
🔀 Both handle traffic, but choosing the right one impacts scalability, cost, and security!

🔀 Load Balancer (L4 - Network Layer)

A Load Balancer distributes external traffic to Kubernetes services at the network layer (L4 – TCP/UDP). Cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) provision external load balancers when a Service type is set to LoadBalancer.

When to Use a Load Balancer?
✔️ When you need to expose a single service directly to the internet.
✔️ For external traffic distribution with minimal setup.
✔️ If you need low-latency load balancing at the network level.

Benefit 👇
✔️ Simple to configure – just define a Service as LoadBalancer.
✔️ Efficient traffic routing at Layer 4 (TCP/UDP).
✔️ Cloud-managed (AWS ELB, Azure LB, GCP LB).

🔀 Ingress Controller (L7 - Application Layer)

An Ingress Controller manages HTTP(S) traffic at the application layer (L7), routing requests based on hostnames, paths, and SSL/TLS termination. It exposes multiple services via a single entry point using an Ingress resource.

When to Use an Ingress Controller?
✔️ When you need to expose multiple services under a single external IP.
✔️ For host/path-based routing (e.g., api.example.com → Service A, web.example.com → Service B).
✔️ If you need TLS termination, rate limiting, and authentication.

Benefit 👇
✔️ Consolidates traffic through one IP → Cost-effective.
✔️ Supports advanced routing (host, path, and header-based).
✔️ TLS termination & security features (authentication, rate-limiting).
