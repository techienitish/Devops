First interview question ðŸ‘‰ Tell me something about yourself

You should follow a structure to answer this:

1. Describe ur current role and work
2. Talk about ur achievements
3. Talk about your expertise
4. Show your interest

Example:
I am Nitish Dubey currently working as SRE II and my work is to deliver the end-to-end process Monitoring in an optimized manner. In the last 4 years I have developed expertise in Aws, Kubernetes, and handling CICD operations and recently helped organisation to cut the cost by 30% by developing a lambda function to delete unused EBS volume. I am very passionate about using cloud & Kubernetes and looking forward to it.

DevOps questions to prepare for the interview:

1) A new junior engineer accidentally deleted a production database. What immediate actions would you take, and how would you prevent this from happening again?

2) A new Docker image you pushed is 1GB in size, causing slow deployments. How would you optimize it?

3) Your team accidentally exposed AWS credentials in a public repository. What immediate actions should you take?
