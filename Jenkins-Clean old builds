HOW TO CLEAN AND RESET JENKINS BUILD HISTORY

When working with Jenkins while building your solution, definitely you have to run your project multiple times.
It will result to a long Build History list that utilizes lot of diskspace and unnecessary for your production environment.

 If you need to clean this Build History, and reset the build number, you can run a simple script in  Jenkins Script Console. Here are the steps to do so.

1. Go to `Jenkins Script Console`
Go to your Jenkins home page > Manage Jenkins > Script Console



2. Run the script to clean and reset

Copy and paste this script to your Console Script text area and change the "Name-of-the-job" to project name( ex : Ceva_Logistics/build_salesbook) that you need to clean the history. Then click the "Run button". 

Also keep reallyDelete=true if you proceed to delete that Job.

// Jenkins job
def jobName = 'Name-of-the-job'
// Range of builds to delete
def rs = Fingerprint.RangeSet.fromString("1-18", false);
// Set to true to actually delete. Use false to test the script.
def reallyDelete = false;

// ----------------------------------
def job = Jenkins.instance.getItemByFullName(jobName);
println("Job: ${job.fullName}");

def builds = Jenkins.instance.getItemByFullName(jobName).getBuilds(rs);
println("Found ${builds.size()} builds");
builds.each{ b-> 
  if (reallyDelete) {
    println("Deleting ${b}");
    b.delete();
  } else {
    println("Found match ${b}"); 
  }
}

Now check your Build History for the particular project, Wow!, it's clean now!

To clear all the failed builds use below script

def jobName = '...'

Jenkins.instance.getItemByFullName(jobName).builds.findAll { it.result == Result.FAILURE}.each { it.delete() }
